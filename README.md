# ArsGrammatica

Grammatical treatises were often titled `Ars Grammatica` in antiquity and up to modernity. Like those treatises, this
program strives to help the student learn the grammar (morphology and syntax) of Latin and Greek.

Broadly, this application is structured on the following layers (from top to bottom):

1. UI
2. lesson modules
3. software tutor
4. model of student abilities
5. part-of-speech tagging
6. tokenization
